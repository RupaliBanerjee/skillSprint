# SkillSprint for Project Based Learning




The upcoming section presents a comprehensive overview of the key features integrated into the application. It begins with the login and signup stages, where users provide their credentials or create new accounts. Once logged in, users are directed to account-specific dashboards. For students, the dashboard displays assignment details, due dates, current progress, recent scores, and available assignments for enrollment. Lecturers' dashboards feature widgets showcasing active assignments and projects, pending evaluations, student performance in previous assignments, and assignment popularity. 

Mentor dashboards display active projects, submitted projects, and unassigned tasks, along with an overview of student average scores in past projects. Lecturers have the flexibility to publish new assignments, evaluate completed tasks, and assign subtasks from mentors. The mentor account allows for publishing projects with multiple subtasks that can be assigned to various students based on sequential dependency. When publishing assignments and projects, appropriate titles, summaries, comments, and assessment criteria are included. 

Students can review provided PDFs before enrolling in assignments to assess alignment with their professional goals. Submissions are made via Dropbox links, and evaluation is based on the pre-defined assessment criteria. Student deadlines for assigned subtasks are displayed on their dashboards. Past scores help students identify areas for improvement. The lecturer can use task popularity charts to decide on future assignment topics, ensuring a well-curated Project-based learning application based on students' interests.
